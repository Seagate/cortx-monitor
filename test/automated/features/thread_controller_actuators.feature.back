    Given I send in the actuator message to stop raid sensor
    When SSPL Stops the thread for raid sensor msg handler
    Then I get the Stop Successful JSON response message

    Given I send in the actuator message to start raid sensor
    When SSPL Starts the thread for raid sensor msg handler
    Then I get the Start Successful JSON response message

Scenario: Send SSPL a thread_controller actuator to stop raid sensor and then request thread status
    Given I request to stop raid sensor and then I request a thread status
    When SSPL Stops the raid sensor and receives a request for thread status
    Then I get the Stop Successful JSON message then I get the thread status message
