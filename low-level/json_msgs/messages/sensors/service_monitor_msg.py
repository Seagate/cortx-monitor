 ****************************************************************************
  Description:       Defines the JSON message transmitted by the
                    Service Monitor. There may be a time when we need to
                    maintain state as far as messages being transmitted.  This
                    may involve aggregation of multiple messages before
                    transmissions or simply deferring an acknowledgment to
                    a later point in time.  For this reason, the JSON messages
                    are stored as objects which can be queued up, etc.
